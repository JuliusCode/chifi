# chifi
the children hifi

raspberry-pi based media player

take any raspberry like an old zero w, a soundcard or amplification board and a 3d printed housing to build a nice small speaker for your children. or anyone!

installing is easy-peasy:

- create raspberry pi os lite card, preconfigure ssh, password and wifi for headless
- drop the 4 files into the user pi home directory
- run the installer with sudo ./installer.sh

reboot, if everything works out you should hear a bell when it's ready

works as a spotify client (playback without device) or AirPlay sink (recieve from device)
